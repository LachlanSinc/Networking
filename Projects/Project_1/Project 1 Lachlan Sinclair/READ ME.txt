Project 1: chat client and chat serve.

â€ŒInstructions to run:
Step 1: start up chatserve.
python chatserve.py [portnumber]

Step 2: Compile chatclient.
gcc -o chatclient chatclient.c

Step 3: Run the chat client.
./chatclient [HostName] [Portnumber]

Using the program:
Initiate contact by entering a user handle on the chat client, then enter 
a message to send to the server, then repsond from the chatserve process, repeat. 
Use \quit to end the contection. Use crtl+c to exit out of the chatserve process.

Note: I had a conversation with the professor on Piazza about sending the handles in every message.
He ok'd me passing the handles only once per connection since it is farm more effiecent. He asked me
to mention this here and to link the portion of the rubric this affects:
"Verification - chatclient Handle
Gets user "handle", displays "handle" at chatclient prompt, sends "handle" to chatserve with each message"
