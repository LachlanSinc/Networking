Extra credit: my server is multithreaded

Intructions to run:
Step 1: compile the server
gcc -lm -o ftserver ftserver.c

Step 2: startup the server
./ftserver [portnumber]

Step 3: send a command using python
python ftclient.py [host name] [server port] [commands] [dataport]

Using the program:
When setting up the server you will need to provide it a port that that is not already in use. The dataport provided
to the client will also need to not be in use. The program accepts two commands: -l to retrive the directory from the sever and
-g [filename] to copy a file. Any other commands will recieve a invalid command message. To end the server process send it a sigint
by using the key combination ctrl+c.
